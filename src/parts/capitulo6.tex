On the data collection part of this research, resulting data show that an extra data collection module at the vehicles offer a negligible 0.5\% increase in total memory usage  with direct sensor collection and a 5\% increase with application performance management (APM) data collection on the reference hardware. Autonomous vehicles data reuse can significantly improve ITS data challenges with minimal impact on current technology stack.

On the transmission part, we outline the limitations and challenges of shared perception using different V2X technologies and create a framework for easy reproducibility and further research and experimentation.
